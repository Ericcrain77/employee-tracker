## Description
Employee Tracker is a command line application that accepts user input so that when the application is started, you are presented with several options to choose from. Once an option is chosen, you will be presented with a formatted table showing all of the given information in desired category. You may repeat this process through the several other beginning options. When selecting "add" or "update" options, you will be able to edit the table to either include the information you are wanting to add or update the current information within the tables.

Employee Tracker utilizes the following NPM Packages:
* Inquirer.JS - Ables the user to interact with tables via the command-line
* MySQL2 - Ables the user to connect with the database and perform queries
* console.table - prints the MySQL2 rows to the console
* dotenv - protects user's username and password

In order to run the application, in the command line type "node server.js"
